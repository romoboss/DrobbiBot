# DrobbiBot
 A simple fun discord bot created using DSharpPlus and Visual Studio

# The Bot is currently not being hosted publicly!
In order to use this bot you need to create your own bot in the Discord Developer portal, that can be found here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

Once the bot is created you need to copy the bot token, and on the 22nd line replace...
Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN", EnvironmentVariableTarget.Machine)
...with quotation marks surrouding the token.

After the edit the 22nd line should look something like this:
Token = "ehfuwhfh.45425.exampletoken.123456.abcdefgh",
